                    Project Hold W was created as a project to learn and explore about fast paced movement games and what makes
                     them fun as well as what makes them feel nice. It was inspired by the movment mechanics in games such as Titanfall, Dishonored, and Destiny.

                        Created a physics based movement system that allow the player to perform basic actions like moving, crouching, and jumping, but also more
                         advanced features such as vaulting, climbing, and sliding. All of them can be toggled on and off and the code is modular so adding new movement features is easy.
