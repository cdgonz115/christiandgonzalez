                        About Me 
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Christian Gonzalez, I am a student at Arizona State University majoring in Computer Science 
                        and obtaining the computer games certificate (expected to graduate in May of 2022). This is a website dedicated to showcase
                         my contributions to various game projects during my time in college. Over the course of the last three years, I have worked
                        on games for club, classes, game jams, and personal projects. I have worked on dozens of mechanics and systems for games. I especially
                        enjoy working on mechanics related to movement and using math or physics(either simulating or breaking them) to achieve the most satisfying results. I have also implemented many
                        systems such as input managers, UI functionality, enemy behavior and more. My goal is to work in the gaming industry as a game-play programmer working on fun, complex,
                        and polished mechanics for people to use. And I believe that being part of the Video Game Development Club at ASU as one of the current Systems Officer not only has given much insight
                        on working on large team projects, but it has also put me on the path towards fulfilling my dream.
